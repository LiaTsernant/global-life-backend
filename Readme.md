### My story
As a traveler, I want to travel and feel safe.
When I had an experience calling 911, I had to wait for 10 minutes to be redirected to emergency phone number and then I needed to explain again my problem.
What if I know I need emergency NOW and I donâ€™t have time to explain my problem twice?
I decided to build an application that displays local direct numbers of rescue services in the location of the device and allows to call these services.

Thanks to our instructors who helped to make this real:
 - Allen Wright
 - Isha Arora
 - Carson Butterfield,
 - Brock Whitbread-Cole   
 - Kenny Bushman
